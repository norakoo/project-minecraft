# Project-Minecraft

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
**Project-Minecraft** is a personal hobby project with a big challenge in mind:  
recreating the core mechanics of **Minecraft** entirely from scratch.  

This is **not** an attempt to compete with or replace the original game, but rather:
- ðŸ§  A way to **learn Java deeply** through a practical, complex project.  
- ðŸŽ¯ A way to **accomplish a long-term goal**, proving persistence and creativity.  
- ðŸŽ® A way to explore the logic behind one of the most iconic sandbox games.  

Think of it less as *making Minecraft 2.0* and more as a **learning journey through code, game mechanics, and design**.

---

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Rebuild Minecraftâ€™s **core engine** in Java.  
- Learn about **rendering, physics, chunk systems, and procedural generation**.  
- Implement **basic gameplay features** (blocks, world saving, player movement).  
- Experiment with **game optimization** and memory management.  
- Keep everything **modular and expandable** for future improvements.  

---

## ðŸ“š Learning Path
While building **Project-Minecraft**, the focus is also on learning key computer science/game dev topics:
- **Java fundamentals** â†’ OOP, data structures, concurrency.  
- **Game engine design** â†’ render loops, input handling, update ticks.  
- **Math & algorithms** â†’ vector math, noise generation, collision detection.  
- **Optimization** â†’ garbage collection control, memory profiling.  

---

## ðŸ”¥ Challenges
- Making the engine run smoothly with **infinite terrain**.  
- Designing a **lighting system** similar to Minecraftâ€™s (smooth yet performant).  
- Balancing between **clean code** and **performance hacks**.  
- Staying consistent in a **long-term project**.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation
At the end of the day, **Project-Minecraft** isnâ€™t about finishing a perfect clone.  
Itâ€™s about:  
- Growing as a Java developer.  
- Understanding how complex games are built.  
- Having fun with a **passion project** that mixes creativity and code.  

Whether it ends up being a small prototype or a fully functional game, it will serve as a **major learning milestone**.
